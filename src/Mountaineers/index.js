          For the Mountaineers group we strive to provide an environment that
          kindles the spark that will become a lifetime love of learning. In our
          program we aim to instill a passion for good literature and music. This
          in turn, helps prepare children for Kindergarten by building phonemic
          awareness and increasing vocabulary, which are both crucial skills for
          future reading success. We meet with the children several times a week
          in small groups to work on acquiring skills such as cutting with scissors,
          writing, and math concepts to further insure that the children are
          prepared with the tools they need as they move on to Kindergarten. We
          engage in lots of open-ended art activities, which allows the children
          to practice their self-expression and experiment with symbolic
          representation.  We also provide many opportunities for free-play,
          which allows the children to practice problem solving, strengthen
          friendships, use their imaginations, and most importantly have fun!

          We have extended our day until 1:00 in order to meet our goals, we will
          also be starting our learning time earlier in the morning to take full
          advantage of every moment in our day!</p>
