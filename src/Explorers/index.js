          In our young Explorers group, we provide an environment where the
          children can learn through play and develop a positive self-image.
          Since children at this stage of development depend on their sense of
          touch to learn about the world around them, we always provide a
          tactile activity area such as play dough, sand, or water for the
          children to explore.  These activities help children to feel both
          calm and alert, while also promoting fine motor skills and inspiring
          children's imaginations.  Over the course of the year, the children
          are introduced to a variety of engaging age appropriate activities
          including cooking projects, science exploration, and many different
          art mediums. However, the emphasis is always on the process of the
          experience rather then the end result or the product.  We also
          support the children's rapidly growing language skills and
          development with prayers, songs, stories, rhymes and conversation.
          We always encourage the children to use their words and help them
          verbalize their needs.As the children become increasingly comfortable
          in their new environment, we join the Bet group for shared activities
          throughout the day.

          In our older Explorers group, we focus on helping children expand on
          the skills theyâ€™ve learned in the Aleph group. We also help to widen
          their window into the outside world by sharing new ideas and experiences
          with them. Children at this age are ready to begin moving from parallel
          play towards cooperative play, and we support this development by teaching
          them the social skills they need to feel successful. We model using
          words to communicate needs, wants, and ideas. We also help guide children
          in reading each other's non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and
          body language. When conflicts do arise we emphasize creative problem
          solving while modeling empathy and respect for all children involved.
          We focus on developing skills for communication, and helping the children
          find new tools for self-expression. This is done through many mediums such
          as art, music dictation, and daily conversation. Letters, numbers, shapes
          and colors are an everyday part of our curriculum as well, though they are
          always introduced in a way that is organic and meaningful to the children.

          While both groups work together sharing space and exploring together, the
          teachers are sensitive to the needs and development of each individual
          child, meeting them where they are at developmentally, and differentiating
          curriculum as needed.
