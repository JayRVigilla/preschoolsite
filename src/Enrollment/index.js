      <p>Once a child is enrolled, parents are encouraged to make arrangements to visit school with their child to acquaint him or her with the staff, environment and classmates prior to their first day of school. It is important for both the parent and the child to feel comfortable in the school.</p>
      <p>It is required by law, that the school be equipped with a Certificate of Immunization (or signed exemption form), DSS forms, and a copy of the child's health form/physical signed by a doctor. All forms must be submitted before the first day of school or children will not be admitted in their classroom. </p>
